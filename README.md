# Announcement :loudspeaker: 

This repository is transferred from [gdm-SynseneHealth](https://github.com/sensynehealth/polaris-rules-engine) to Huma organisation as part of change in asset ownership 
# Polaris Rules Engine

The Rules Engine is part of the Polaris platform (formerly DHOS). This service is  a Node.js microservice to expose an API for a rules engine.

The rules engine is "JSON Rules Engine" (https://github.com/CacheControl/json-rules-engine)

**This service is intended to be wrapped by the Polaris PDF API.** This service is expected to be running locally. For this reason, the API exposed by the Rules Engine is not protected by endpoint security.

# Running locally

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
yarn start
```

# Running in Docker

```bash
docker build -t dhos-rules-engine/v18.1 . # once
docker run -p 3000:3000 -t dhos-rules-engine/v18.1
```

# Using rules in the browser

The service exposes each rule type as an importable script. It requires an import of `moment.js`.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Title</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.22.2/moment.js"></script>
